# Flight Price Prediction with Deep Learning

This project explores the dataset extracted from "Ease My Trip" website, and is used to predict flight ticket prices using real-world data. It compares **two versions of a neural network model**: one basic, and one enhanced with smart, domain-inspired feature engineering as well as answering the proposed questions from Kaggle.

## Objective

The goal of this project is not just to build an accurate model, but also to answer these proposed airline pricing questions:

**a)** Does price vary with different **airlines**?  
**b)** How is the price affected when tickets are bought just **1 or 2 days before departure**?  
**c)** Does the ticket price change based on **departure** and **arrival time**?  
**d)** How does price change between different **source** and **destination** combinations?  
**e)** How does the ticket price vary between **Economy** and **Business class**?

These questions are approached by building interpretable models and using smart features to capture these patterns.

## Dataset

The dataset comes directly from Kaggle's "Flight Price Prediction" challenge and contains details like:
- Airline, source/destination cities  
- Departure/arrival time categories  
- Number of stops, travel class, days left until flight  
- Duration of the flight  
- Price (target variable)

## Model Version 1: Basic Deep Learning Regressor

### What it does:
This version encodes all categorical variables numerically and feeds them into an embedding-based model, along with numerical features.

### ðŸ”§ Key Code:
```python
cat_cols_v1 = ['airline', 'source_city', 'departure_time', 'stops', 
               'arrival_time', 'destination_city', 'class']

# Encode categoricals
for col in cat_cols_v1:
    df[col] = df[col].astype('category').cat.codes
```

Then create **embedding layers for each categorical variable**, flatten them, and concatenate them with the numeric features.

```python
embedding_sizes = {
    col: (df[col].nunique(), min(50, (df[col].nunique() + 1) // 2)) 
    for col in cat_cols_v1
}

x = Concatenate()(embedded_inputs + [numerical_input])
x = Dense(128, activation='relu')(x)
x = Dropout(0.2)(x)
x = Dense(64, activation='relu')(x)
output = Dense(1)(x)
```

## Model Version 2: With Feature Engineering

### Whatâ€™s new here:
This version introduces several domain-inspired features designed to help answer the research questions more explicitly:

- **Departure hour** (mapped from `departure_time`)
- **Weekend indicator** (`is_weekend`)
- **Route frequency** (`route_count`)
- **Class + duration combo** (`economy_long_haul`)
- **Booking window category** (to explore last-minute pricing)
- **Duration binning** (short vs long-haul)
- **Peak season indicator**

### Feature Engineering Snippet:
```python
df['departure_hour'] = df['departure_time'].map({...})
df['is_weekend'] = df['departure_time'].isin(['Evening', 'Night']).astype(int)
df['booking_window'] = pd.cut(df['days_left'], bins=[0,3,7,14,30,365], labels=[...])
df['duration_bin'] = pd.cut(df['duration'], bins=[0,2,4,6,24], labels=[...])
```

The architecture remains the same: embeddings for categoricals + dense layers for regression.

## Results & Comparison

After training and evaluating both models:

| Metric             | V1        | V2        | Best Model    |
|--------------------|-----------|-----------|---------------|
| **MAE**            | â‚¹3207.09  | â‚¹3233.95  | V1 (slightly) |
| **RMSE**           | â‚¹5377.61  | â‚¹5191.02  | V2          |
| **RÂ²**             | 0.9439    | 0.9477    | V2          |
| **Expl. Variance** | 0.9440    | 0.9478    | V2          |

## Visual Insights

### ðŸ“Š Error Distribution (V1 vs V2)

> *Distribution of prediction errors for both models. V2 appears to have a tighter distribution with fewer extreme outliers.*

## Learning

Now, connecting back to the **research questions**:

| Question | Findings |
|----------|-------------|
| **a. Airlines** | The `airline` variable had a strong impact on price, as seen in its embedding size and learned weights. |
| **b. Days before departure** | Price increases significantly when `days_left` is low. The `booking_window` feature showed clear patterns, especially in last-minute bins. |
| **c. Departure/Arrival Time** | Features like `departure_hour` and `is_weekend` helped capture time-based pricing differences. |
| **d. Source/Destination** | The `route_count` and city combinations revealed significant price differences. |
| **e. Class type** | Economy vs. Business was one of the most influential factors â€” clearly reflected in predictions. |

## Final Thoughts

Predicting flight prices isn't easy â€” airlines are unpredictable!  
But with the right data and a thoughtful mix of **embeddings + features**, one can get surprisingly close.
